     // The Bubble Sort is quite inefficient

     // Time complexity: O(n2) in average and worst cases. (Worse Case is when the
     // array is reversely sorted). But if the array is already sorted (best case) it
     // needs n-1 comparisons (approximately n). Thus O(n) is the time complexity in
     // best case.

     // Space Complexity: This requires one temp variable for a swap
     // No matter how many swaps it will only swap one at a time therefore Space Complexity is O(1).
